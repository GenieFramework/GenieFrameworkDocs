      "content": "Having installed yarn and attempting to create a simple chart with Chart.js as an example, I don't think I've set this up correctly. I see that yarn and nodejs are installed, and yarn add chart created the node_modules and package.json files in my top level directoy of the genie app (where app, bin,config etc. live). However the documentation says that the yarn modules should be living in public/dist. I don't have a public/dist folder yet. Attempting to import chart in my main js file results in \"cannot use import statement outside a module\", which the internet tells me might be because chart is not in the correct location.  I've searched around a bit but can't find any specific guidance outside of the documentation below as to how to properly install external assets in the genie framework and how to verify that it was done properly.\n \nI followed the documentation here https://geniejl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/guides/Frontend_assets/",

At this point though the vast majority of my UI is finished just using base JavaScript/html/css (manually created in the public folder as you described). The main feature I’m missing is to be able to embed three.js animations which I believe requires nodejs. If I can figure out how to use a package manager with genie then I would use that for things like chart as well.",

If it isn't obvious already, I'm not really a web developer. It seems that what I'm trying to do is to use genie.jl to host the webapp mainly for it's router to do some heavy julia computing on the backend, but hoping to use javascript modules that depend on a node.js server on the front end (namely three.js). So it appears that I would like to host my web server with genie.jl,  but then also run a node.js server on the side for accessing my node_modules folder js packages.\n\nThat is, unless Genie with yarn and webpack already somehow gives me access and the proper scope to use js packages in node_modules in my genie hosted webapp. For the record, I'm not sure anything I'm saying is making sense!",
