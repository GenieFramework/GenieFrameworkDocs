      "content": "I often found to have to \"fight\" to get the desired layout and styling, which I attribute from the various style that Stipple inject by default, plus de ones from Quasar. \n\n I found the html generated by GenieBuilder a promising approach as it provides to write generic html and integrate Quasar compoenents directly as found from the docs. Ex: https://quasar.dev/vue-components/select#overview\n```julia\n<h3>SubTitle</h3>\n<q-select v-model=\"item\" :options=\"item_options\" label=\"MyLabel\"></q-select>\n```\n\nHowever, the above only works if called through `@page` or `Stipple.Pages.Page`, which injects various formating along a footer. \n\nAlternatively, if trying to go with the regular `html` route: \n```jullia\n    html(\n        :mini,\n        :ui;\n        layout = :app,\n        context = MiniController,\n        Model = MiniController.handlers(),\n    )\n```\n\nIt wouldn't display the reactive element (select items) even if the various scripts are integrated like:\n```\n    <script src=\"/stipple.jl/master/assets/js/vue.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/stipple.jl/master/assets/js/stipplecore.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/stippleui.jl/master/assets/js/quasar.umd.min.js\"></script>\n```\nMy understanding being that it misses the `MiniController.js`  script that Stipple generates. \n\nSo in summary, is there a path to get such workflow where one could just build the UI through straight html, similar to what GenieBuilder generates, while keeping in control of the styling elements? \nThe general idea would be to be able to start from a vanilla styled page and then be able to add a Bootstrap4 or 5 version as one see fit, or any other assets ones may need. \n\nFor info, the above tests were done here:\nhttps://github.com/jeremiedb/GenieExperiments.jl/blob/dev/routes.jl",
