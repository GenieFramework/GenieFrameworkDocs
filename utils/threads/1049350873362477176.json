      "content": "Hi - I want to have a button that @onclick determines a URL with code and then opens that URL in the browser. \n\nI know how to do each separately ... I have one button that, when clicked, runs a handler that looks at elements on the web page (selections and text boxes), forms the URL and stores that in an `@out builderlink` bound variable. \n\nThen I have another \"Go\" button that has `:href=\"builderLink\" target=\"_blank\"` . \n\nThis means that I have to press both of these buttons (in the right order). \n\nI have a feeling that there's some Genie function I can run from the handler of the first button that can open the browser to that determined URL. I just don't know what that function is. Can someone let me know? Thanks! \n\n[By the way - this `help-forum` is really great! Thanks everyone in advance for answers].",
