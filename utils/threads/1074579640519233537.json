Any particular settings in VS Code?\n\nBackground: Somehow I cannot access element properties in no-code builder. I am having the issue on multiple arhitectures and multiple OS. It is all the same, if I use Genie Builder insider or regular and v0.1.x or 0.2.x or 0.3.1-0.3.3. I have checked the the tutorials and documentation, with little success.\n\nLooks like systematic error on my side and I would appreciate help.",
