As part of this, I need develop an API that will run the Julia script I've developed... However, I know nothing about web dev! Is this my only tutorial to go off of? https://genieframework.com/docs/genie/docs/guides/Simple-API-backend.html\n\nIf my script can accept JSON, I assume the api \"response\" is the \"return\" from my script function? \n\nI'm really not sure where to start and would appreciate any guidance. (Even if there is an article / tutorial that is in a different language but would give me more context on how this stuff works.) I am really starting from \"level 0\" here.",
