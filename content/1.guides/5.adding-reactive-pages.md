# Adding reactive pages

In Genie Framework, the `Stipple.jl` package implements a reactive UI layer that enables dynamic interactivity with the UI. This is useful for building apps that require real-time updates, such as dashboards, data visualizations, and simulations.

We refer to this type of interfaces as reactive, since the app instantly reacts to a user action by executing some code and updating the UI. **All without having to reload the page**. This is made possible by the Javascript code provided by `Stipple.jl` that enables two-way synchronization between the browser and the server.

There are several possible patterns for apps with reactive pages. For more details on building reactive apps, see the [Your first dashboard](/guides/your-first-dashboard) guide and the [docs](/reference/reactive-UI).

### Single app module with multiple pages

When building apps without too much logic, it might be sufficient to keep it all in a single module even if there's multiple pages. You just need to define additional routes for each page as in this example, which uses the `StatisticAnalysisl` module defined [here](/guides/your-first-dashboard):

```julia [app.jl]
module App
using GenieFramework
#import your Julia code
include("lib/StatisticAnalysis.jl")
using .StatisticAnalysis
@genietools

# Implement reactive code
@app begin
    @in N = 0
    @out m = 0.0
    @out name = "John"
    @onchange N begin
        m = calc_mean(gen_numbers(N))
    end
end

# Define the UI for each page
index() = [h1("Welcome {{name}}!"), a(href="/form")]
function formui()
    cell([
        textfield("How many numbers?", :N),
        p("The average of {{N}} random numbers is {{m}}"),
    ])
end


# Define the routes
@page("/", index)
@page("/form", formui)
end
```

Alternatively, you can place the UI code in a separate file and include it as
```julia [app.jl]
@page("/", "ui.jl")
```

```julia [ui.jl]
    cell([
        textfield("How many numbers?", :N),
        p("The average of {{N}} random numbers is {{m}}"),
    ])
```

### Multiple app modules

If each page performs different functions, for instance a dashboard page and a another page with a  configuration panel, you can implement them in separate logic modules. Then, simply include them with a `@page` route in the main app module as in this example:

```julia [App.jl]
module App
using GenieFramework
@page("/", "index.jl", DEFAULT_LAYOUT(), Main.App.Index)
@page("/form", "form.jl", DEFAULT_LAYOUT(), Main.App.Form)
end
````



```julia [Index.jl]
module Form
using GenieFramework

@app begin
    @out name = "John"
end

function ui()
    h1("Welcome {{name}}!"),
end

end
```

```julia [Form.jl]
module Form
using GenieFramework
include("lib/StatisticAnalysis.jl")
using .StatisticAnalysis

@app begin
    @in N = 0
    @out m = 0.0
    @onchange N begin
        m = calc_mean(gen_numbers(N))
    end
end

function ui()
    cell([
        textfield("How many numbers?", :N),
        p("The average of {{N}} random numbers is {{m}}"),
    ])
end

end
```
