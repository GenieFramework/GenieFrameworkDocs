## Stipple v0.27.4

Now you can extend your reactive variables with fields from a struct using the `@mixin`macro.

**Closed issues:**
- Docs / Location of the guides for Stipple (#134)
-   `@in` partnersforroles::Dict{Integer,Integer} will not trigger `@onchange` (#169)
- `Stipple.render()` not working as expected for `Dict{String, Vector{Any}}` (#213)
- Loading Stipple affects convertion of JSON3.Dict into Dict (#214)
- Why does `@mixin` only work for named models? (#216)

**Merged pull requests:**
- define flexgrid_kwargs, refactor cell, row, column (#215) (<@960642755799941150>)
- docs: onchange macro example fix (#217) (@ms10596)
