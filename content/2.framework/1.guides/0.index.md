# Welcome to Genie Framework!

Genie is a powerful full-stack web framework for the Julia programming language, perfect for building interactive UIs, APIs, and production-grade web apps. It offers a simple, low-code approach that makes web development accessible to Julia users, even those with no prior web development experience.

Genie Framework has three main components: Genie, Stipple, SearchLight and Genie Builder.

**[Genie.jl](/framework/genie.jl/docs/)** provides backend and frontend tools, so that you can build **full stack web apps** and APIs around your Julia code.

For **real-time interactivity** and a rich UI, like what's needed in a **dashboard**, **[Stipple.jl](/framework/stipple.jl/docs/)** provides a reactive UI layer.

For **database persistence**, Genie's ORM, **[SearchLight.jl](/framework/searchlight.jl/docs)**, can be added at any time.


## Getting started

You can install Genie Framework from the Julia REPL by entering Pkg mode with `]` and typing 

```julia-repl
pkg> add GenieFramework
```
This will install `Genie.jl`, `Stipple.jl` along with other accessory packages. To work with databases, you'll need to install `SearchLight.jl` separately.

To create a basic webpage with Genie.jl see the [Creating web pages](/framework/genie.jl/guides/creating-web-pages) guide, or check out  [this guide](/framework/genie.jl/guides/creating-an-api) to add an API to your app.

To build an interactive **dashboard** with Stipple.jl, check out the [First dashboard](/framework/stipple.jl/guides/first-dashboard) guide and the [Component gallery](/framework/stipple.jl/docs/component-gallery). To build a multipage app, head over to the [Multipage apps](/framework/stipple.jl/guides/multipage-apps) guide.
