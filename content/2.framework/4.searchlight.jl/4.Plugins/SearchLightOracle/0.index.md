# SearchLightOracle

## Purpose of the project

The project fullfills the API of SearchLight. The adpater can be used for communicating with
Oracle databases.

### Supported systems

- Linux
- MacOS

### Restrictions

Please note that the adapter will not work on Windows systems because for now Oracle.jl has to
compile a small amount of C source code to change a needed library. This isn't done until today
for Windows systems. If this is solved, this adapter can be used on Windows systems.
