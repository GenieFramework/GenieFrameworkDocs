# Welcome to Genie Framework!

Genie is a powerful full-stack web framework for the Julia programming language, perfect for building interactive UIs, APIs, and production-grade web apps. It offers a simple, low-code approach that makes web development accessible to Julia users, even those with no prior web development experience.

Genie Framework has three main components: Genie, Stipple, SearchLight and Genie Builder.

**[Genie.jl](/framework/genie.jl/docs/)** provides backend and frontend tools, so that you can build **full stack web apps** and APIs around your Julia code.

For **real-time interactivity** and a rich UI, like what's needed in a **dashboard**, **[Stipple.jl](/framework/stipple.jl/docs/)** provides a reactive UI layer.

For **database persistence**, Genie's ORM, **[SearchLight.jl](/framework/searchlight.jl/docs)**, can be added at any time.


## Getting started

Let's create your first Genie app in a few quick steps:

1. Open your terminal and create a new folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir MyGenieApp
cd MyGenieApp
```

2. In your project folder, start Julia with the current project activated:

```bash
julia --project
```

3. In the Julia REPL, enter `Pkg` mode by typing ], then install `GenieFramework.jl`:

```julia
pkg> add GenieFramework
```

This command installs `Genie.jl`, `Stipple.jl` and its dependencies in your project.

4. Create a file named app.jl file with the following content:

```julia
module App

using GenieFramework
@genietools

@app begin
  @in name = "Genie"
end

function ui()
  [
    h1("My First Genie App")
    input("Enter your name", :name)
    p("Hello {{message}}!")
  ]
end

@page("/", ui)
end
```

Using the `Stipple.jl` API, this code defines an interactive dashboard application with a reactive message.

5. Exit `Pkg` mode by pressing backspace. Then, in the Julia REPL, load and run your app:

```julia
using GenieFramework
Genie.loadapp()
up()
```

6. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8000. You should see your "Hello, Genie!" message.

That's it! You've created, set up, and run your first Genie application. Read the documentation of each package to continue building your app.

To build an interactive **dashboard** with `Stipple.jl`, check out the [First dashboard](/framework/stipple.jl/guides/first-dashboard) guide and the [Component gallery](/framework/stipple.jl/docs/component-gallery). To build a multipage app, head over to the [Multipage apps](/docs/guides/multipage-apps) guide.

To serve a static webpage  with `Genie.jl`  see [Creating web pages](/framework/genie.jl/guides/creating-web-pages) guide, and check out the [API](/framework/genie.jl/guides/creating-an-api) guide to learn to work with web APIs.
