## Styling Genie apps

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language for styling HTML documents, enabling developers to separate design from content. CSS enhances websites with visually appealing layouts, improved loading times, responsive design, and cross-browser compatibility.

In a Genie app you can use inline CSS [style attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php) or define your own stylesheets in the `public/` folder. These will be automatically imported into your app's page without needing to edit the document `head`. Moreover, you can also use the predefined classes provided by the Quasar framework.

Here's an example of a page using several CSS styles and classes:
```html
  <h1 class="blue-text">Heading</h1>
  <p style="color: green; background: cyan">Inline styled paragraph.</p>
  <p class="red-text">Paragraph with class.</p>
```

The classes are defined in the `public/styles.css` file, where specific elements are targeted with selectors:

```css
/* Class Selector */
.red-text {
  color: red;
}

/* Element Selector */
p {
  font-size: 14px;
}

/* Class Selector */
.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}
```

Moreover, the Quasar components come with their own pre-defined CSS classes. These classes are added to the HTML elements to style the layout, paddings, and more. For example, the `q-pa-sm` class adds small padding to an element, while the `col-12` class sets the width of a column in a 12-column grid layout:

```html
<div class="q-pa-sm col-12">
  <p>This paragraph has small padding and takes the full width of the container.</p>
</div>
```
