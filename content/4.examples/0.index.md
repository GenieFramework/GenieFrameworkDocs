## Code examples

This section contains short code examples showcasing the features of [Genie Framework](/docs/overview). To use them, simply copy and paste them into a Julia `app.jl` file and run it with `include("app.jl")`.

### Usage on Genie Cloud

To run the examples on Genie Cloud, paste the code into the `app.jl` file. Moreover, remove the call to `Server.up()` at the bottom; Genie Cloud's development environment automatically starts the server.

Most of these short examples define the UI with a `ui` function that uses the [low-code API](/guides/designing-the-ui-lowcode). To use a UI created with the no-code editor, simply replace the call `@page("/", ui)` with `@page("/", "app.jl.html")`.
