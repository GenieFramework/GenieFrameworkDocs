## Code examples

This section contains short code examples showcasing the features of [Genie Framework](/docs/overview). To use them, simply copy and paste them into a Julia `app.jl` file and run it with `include("app.jl")`.

If you'd like to contribute with an example, open a pull request on the [CodeExamples](https://github.com/GenieFramework/CodeExamples) repository.
