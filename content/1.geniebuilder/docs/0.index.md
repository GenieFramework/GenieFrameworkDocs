# Introducing Genie Builder 1.0

Genie Builder is a VS Code extension that helps you build Julia web apps 10x faster. It features a no-code, drag & drop editor to help you create rich UIs without having to write a single line of html or javascript. It also features an AI assistant to help you generate UIs and for ad-hoc documentation and code examples. For the backend of your application, simply add your Julia code and expose the variables you want to link to your UI with simple macros. All in pure Julia, using Genie Framework's low-code layer.
