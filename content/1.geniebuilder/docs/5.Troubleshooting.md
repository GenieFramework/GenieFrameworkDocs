### Genie Builder not starting

Check that you have Julia correctly installed on your system. To install it, use [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) or follow the platform-specific instructions [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform). Make sure Julia is on your PATH so that it can be executed from VSCode's terminal. If you use `juliaup` to install Julia, it'll automatically add it to PATH.

### Resetting Genie Builder

On first launch, Genie Builder will create a configuration folder in `~/.geniebuilder`. To reset the extension, delete the configuration folder and launch Genie Builder again. You'll be asked to log in like the first time you launched the extension.


### Code not reloading when changed

Genie Builder uses `Revise` to handle code reloading in the `app.jl` file. If you place files in the `lib` folder, they should be reloaded automatically. When importing code with `include`, it will not automatically reload when changed. You'll need to use `Revise`'s `includet` function instead.

Moreover, only the code inside a function or the `@app` block will be reloaded. If for example you declare a variable at the module level, it won't reload automatically; a restart of the app is needed in this case.


### App in bugged state

If your app is showing a bug icon, check the terminal for any errors or read through the [logs](/geniebuilder/docs/usage-guide#debugging-apps).

### Importing static assets

Place static assets like images and stylesheets in the `public` folder. For example, in the visual editor, an image in `public/logo.png` can be added with an image component and the image path set to  `/logo.png`.

In the Julia code, to include assets with the `add_script` and `add_css` functions, you'll have to specify the full path:

```julia
Stipple.Layout.add_css("public/styles.css")
Stipple.Layout.add_script("public/script.js")
```
### Error "table schema_migrations already exists" when launching

If you see  an error in the REPL similar to "table schema_migrations already exists" when launching GB, it means that there's a conflict older versions of the plugin. To fix this, delete the `~/.geniebuilder` and `~/.julia/geniebuilder` folders and relaunch Genie Builder.

### App not starting

There could be several reasons why an app is not starting after loading it in Genie Builder:

- Missing packages: make sure to install all the dependencies with the package manager before adding any imports to `app.jl`.
- Bug in the code: if there are bugs in the code, the app will not run. Check the terminal and the [logs](/geniebuilder/docs/usage-guide#debugging-apps).
- Long startup: on a first run, setting up the Genie Builder can take a few minutes.
