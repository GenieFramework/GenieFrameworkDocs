### Saving and reading

SearchLight exposes two similar data persistence methods: `save!` and `save`. They both perform the same action
(persisting the object to the database), but `save` will return a `Bool` of value `true` to indicate that the operation
was successful or a `Bool` of value `false` to indicate that the operation has failed. While the `save!` variant will
return the persisted object upon success or will throw an exception on failure.
