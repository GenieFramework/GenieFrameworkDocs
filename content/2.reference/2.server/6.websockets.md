# Working with web sockets

Genie provides a powerful workflow for client-server communication over websockets. The system hides away the complexity
of the network level communication, exposing powerful abstractions which resemble Genie's familiar MVC workflow: the
clients and the server exchange messages over `channels` (which are the equivalent of `routes`).

## Registering `channels`

The messages are mapped to a matching channel, where are processed by Genie's `Router` which extracts the payload and
invokes the designated handler (controller method or function). For most purposes, the `channels` are the functional
equivalents of `routes` and are defined in a similar way:

```julia
using Genie.Router

channel("/foo/bar") do
  # process request
end

channel("/baz/bax", YourController.your_handler)
```

The above `channel` definitions will handle websocket messages sent to `/foo/bar` and `/baz/bax`.

## Setting up the client

In order to enable WebSockets communication in the browser we need to load a JavaScript file. This is provided by Genie,
through the `Assets` module. Genie makes it extremely easy to setup the WebSockets infrastructure on the client side,
by providing the `Assets.channels_support()` method. For instance, if we want to add support for WebSockets to the root
page of a web app, all we need is this:

```julia
using Genie.Router, Genie.Assets

route("/") do
  Assets.channels_support()
end
```

That is all we need in order to be able to push and receive messages between client and server.

---

## Try it!

You can follow through by running the following Julia code in a Julia REPL:

```julia
using Genie, Genie.Router, Genie.Assets

Genie.config.websockets_server = true # enable the websockets server

route("/") do
  Assets.channels_support()
end

up() # start the servers
```

Now if you visit <http://localhost:8000> you'll get a blank page -- which, however, includes all the necessary
functionality for WebSockets communication! If you use the browser's developer tools, the Network pane will indicate
that a `channels.js` file was loaded and that a WebSockets request was made (Status 101 over GET). Additionally, if you
peek at the Console, you will see a `Subscription ready` message.

**What happened?**

At this point, by invoking `Assets.channels_support()`, Genie has done the following:

* loaded the bundled `channels.js` file which provides a JS API for communicating over WebSockets
* has created two default channels, for subscribing and unsubscribing: `/____/subscribe` and `/____/unsubscribe`
* has invoked `/____/subscribe` and created a WebSockets connection between client and server

### Pushing messages from the server

We are ready to interact with the client. Go to the Julia REPL running the web app and run:

```julia
julia> Genie.WebChannels.connected_clients()
1-element Array{Genie.WebChannels.ChannelClient,1}:
 Genie.WebChannels.ChannelClient(HTTP.WebSockets.WebSocket{HTTP.ConnectionPool.Transaction{Sockets.TCPSocket}}(T0  🔁    0↑🔒    0↓🔒 100s 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 ≣16, 0x01, true, UInt8[0x7b, 0x22, 0x63, 0x68, 0x61, 0x6e, 0x6e, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x22  …  0x79, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x61, 0x64, 0x22, 0x3a, 0x7b, 0x7d, 0x7d], UInt8[], false, false), ["____"])
```

We have one connected client to the `____` channel! We can send it a message:

```julia
julia> Genie.WebChannels.broadcast("____", "Hey!")
true
```

If you look in the browser's console you will see the "Hey!" message! By default, the client side handler simply outputs
the message. We're also informed that we can "Overwrite window.parse_payload to handle messages from the server".
Let's do it. Run this in the current REPL (it will overwrite our root route handler):

```julia
route("/") do
  Assets.channels_support() *
  """
  <script>
  window.parse_payload = function(payload) {
    console.log('Got this payload: ' + payload);
  }
  </script>
  """
end
```

Now if you reload the page and broadcast the message, it will be picked up by our custom payload handler.

We can remove clients that are no longer reachable (for instance, if the browser tab is closed) with:

```julia
julia> Genie.WebChannels.unsubscribe_disconnected_clients()
```

The output of `unsubscribe_disconnected_clients()` is the collection of remaining (connected) clients.

---

**Heads up!**

You should routinely `unsubscribe_disconnected_clients()` to free memory.

---

At any time, we can check the connected clients with `Genie.WebChannels.connected_clients()` and the disconnected ones
with `Genie.WebChannels.disconnected_clients()`.

### Pushing messages from the client

We can also push messages from client to server. As we don't have a UI, we'll use the browser's console and Genie's JavaScript
API to send the messages. But first, we need to set up the `channel` which will receive our message. Run this in the active Julia REPL:

```julia
channel("/____/echo") do
  @info "Received: $(params(:payload))"
end
```

Now that our endpoint is up, go to the browser's console and run:

```javascript
Genie.WebChannels.sendMessageTo('____', 'echo', 'Hello!')
```

The julia terminal and console will both immediately display the response from the server:

```text
Received: Hello!
Got this payload: Received: Hello!
```

## Summary

This concludes our intro to working with WebSockets in Genie. You now have the knowledge to set up the communication between
client and server, send messages from both server and clients, and perform various tasks using the `WebChannels` API.
