# Caveats

Due to its nature as a web development framework, Genie has some idiosyncrasies that are important to keep in mind when developing reactive apps. This page lists some of the most common caveats and how to avoid them.

### Code strings in UI components

Some UI components accept strings with executable code into their arguments. For example:

```julia
btn("Click me", @click("clicked =! clicked; counter += 1"))
p("The counter is {{counter}}")
p("The counter+10 is {{counter + 10}}")
```

Any code that is passed to a UI component is executed in the browser. Therefore, it must be valid Javascript.


### Zero-based indexing

Since Javascript uses 0-based indexing, it is possible to get unexpected results when using Julia arrays in the UI. For example, the following code will work in the browser but it will throw an error in the Julia backend:

```julia
@app begin
    @out text = ["a", "b", "c"]
end

ui() = p("The first element is {{text[0]}}")
```
