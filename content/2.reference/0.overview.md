# The Genie Framework ecosystem

Genie Framework is an open source framework that includes all you need to quickly build production-ready web applications with Julia. With Genie Framework you can develop Julia backends, create beautiful web UIs, build data applications and dashboards, integrate with databases and set up high-performance web services and APIs.

<img  style="float:right;display:block;width:30%;max-width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:0px" src="/assets/guides/intro/genieframeworkdiagram.svg">

Genie Framework has three main components: [Genie](https://github.com/genieframework/genie), [Stipple](https://github.com/genieframework/stipple) and [SearchLight](https://github.com/genieframework/searchlight). 

**Genie.jl** provides backend and frontend tools, so that you can build **full stack web apps** around your Julia code.

For **real-time interactivity** and a rich UI, like what's needed in a **dashboard**, **Stipple.jl** provides a reactive UI layer.

For **database persistence**, Genie's ORM, **SearchLight.jl**, can be added at any time.


<!-- The API for writing backend code and reactive UIs is provided by the package GenieFramework.jl, and it has been specially designed for writing interactive data apps with minimum amounts of boilerplate code. To work with databases, the SearchLight.jl package provides an ORM that works with Julia objects and queries. This reference documentation page covers the [new API](https://genieframework.com/blog/new-API-for-building-Julia-apps-with-less-code.html) in `GenieFramework.jl` and the functionality of `SearchLight.jl`.  -->

<!-- For more advanced use cases such as building MVC apps, adding authentication or developing web services, see the [guides page](/guides). For code examples, see the [App Gallery](/app-gallery) and the [examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/BuiltWithGenie). -->
