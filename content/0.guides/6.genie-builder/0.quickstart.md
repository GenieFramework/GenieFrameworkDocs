# Get started with Genie Cloud

Genie Cloud is a development platform to quickly build web apps around your Julia code. With it you can build anything: interactive dashboards, ML apps, smart tools and complex production apps. All without worrying about frontend code, server stack or hosting.

In fact, Genie Cloud features a no-code, drag & drop builder to quickly develop UIs without having to write a single line of HTML or Javascript. And on top of it, one-click deployments let you instantly publish and share apps. No need to become a devops expert!

Still, power users need not worry. Genie Cloud builds on top of the open source [Genie Framework](https://genieframework.com), which gives you tools such as a low-code UI layer, server backend, authentication, and ORM to build your full-stack apps in pure Julia. See the [documentation](/docs/) section for more information about the Genie Framework API.

This short guide will lead you through the essential steps in building your first app on Genie Cloud.

<!-- Genie Cloud is a platform where you can build and deploy web apps written in Julia. It leverages the power of the open source [Genie Framework](genieframework.com) and a no-code editor to provide a pure Julia workflow; no need to write any HTML or JavaScript! Still, GC provides a low floor high ceiling framework to develop even the most complex apps. This short guide will lead you through the essential steps in building your first Genie app. -->

### Create a new app in the dashboard

The user dashboard shows the existing apps in your development workspace, and the apps that have been deployed to production. To create a new app, click on the plus sign in the grid, give the app a name and set access restrictions, and click "create"

<img class="border-gray-300 border-2" style="display:block;width:90%;max-width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/guides/quickstart/newapp.png">


### Launch the workspace

Open your newly created app in the workspace by clicking on the [:icon{name="ph:pencil"} Edit]{.px-1 .bg-blue-200 .rounded-lg} button. This will launch a development environment based on the VSCode editor in which you can develop the entirety of your app. 

By default, a new app comes with two files: 
- `app.jl` where the logic resides, and
- `app.jl.html` which defines the UI.

You'll manually edit `app.jl` and other files in the workspace, whereas `app.jl.html` can be edited via GC's no-code-editor. 

To preview an in-development app, click on the :icon{name="ph:monitor-play"} icon next to the GET tab. This will open a new tab with your app rendered.

### Add your Julia code

The `app.jl` file comes with a basic skeleton for your app. The block delimited by the `@app` macro will hold the reactive code making the UI interactive. The `@page` macro defines a route, and the file that will be returned to the browser when this route is visited. 

The first step is to install any packages you might need using the builtin package manager.

<img class="border-gray-300 border-2" style="display:block;width:35%;max-width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/guides/quickstart/packagemanager.png">

Then, you can add your Julia code directly in `app.jl` before the `@app` block.

```julia{6-8}
module App
using StatsBase: mean, std, var
using GenieFramework
@genietools

function statistics(x)
  mean(x), std(x), var(x)
end

@app begin
    # reactive code goes here
end

@page("/", "app.jl.html")
end
```


### Implement the UI

Launch the no-code editor by clicking on the eye icon in the left sidebar,

<img class="border-gray-300 border-2" style="display:block;width:30%;max-width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/guides/quickstart/nocode.png">

and start building the UI by dragging UI components onto the canvas.

<img class="border-gray-300 border-2" style="display:block;width:90%;max-width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/guides/quickstart/uibuilding.gif">

When you select a component in the canvas, its configuration options will open in the right sidebar. Here you can set the component's data bindings, and other properties to control its behavior.

### Implement the app's logic

Interactive components such as drop-down selectors, sliders or text fields are bound to variables in the Julia code so that their state can be accessed and modified. You can bind a component to a variable in three steps:

1. Check the binding fields of each component to find out which state variables it requires.

<img class="border-gray-300 border-2" style="display:block;width:40%;max-width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/guides/quickstart/bindings.png">

2. Define the reactive variable in the Julia code, using the `@in` macro if the component stores its state to the variable, or `@out` if the component reads from it.

```julia
@app begin
  @in N = 0
  @out m::Float32 = 0.0
  @out s::Float32  = 0.0
  @out v::Float32  = 0.0
  @out hist = PlotData()
end
```

3. Attach each variable to a component via a binding field in the no-code editor.

<img class="border-gray-300 border-2" style="display:block;width:90%;max-width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/guides/quickstart/bindings.gif">

Now it's time to add reactive code that executes when a state changes. This is done with the `@onchange` macro, which watches one or more variables and executes a block of code when their values change.

````julia
@app begin
  @onchange N begin
    x_rand = randn(N)
    m, s, v = statistics(x_rand)
    hist = PlotData(x=x_rand, plot=StipplePlotly.Charts.PLOT_TYPE_HISTOGRAM)
  end
end
end
````
::alert{type="warning"}
Reactive variables tagged with `@in` or `@out` can only be modified within a block delimited by the `@onchange` macro. Any changes made outside of it will not be reflected in the UI.
::

With this, you'll have a working interactive app. All is left to do is deploy it!

::code-group
````julia [app.jl]
module App
using StatsBase: mean, std, var
using GenieFramework
@genietools

function statistics(x)
  mean(x), std(x), var(x)
end

@app begin
  @out m::Float32 = 0.0
  @out s::Float32  = 0.0
  @out v::Float32  = 0.0
  @in N = 0
  @out hist = PlotData()
  @onchange N begin
    x_rand = randn(N)
    m, s, v = statistics(x_rand)
    hist = PlotData(x=x_rand, plot=StipplePlotly.Charts.PLOT_TYPE_HISTOGRAM)
  end
end

@page("/", "app.jl.html")
end

### Deploy the app

Deploying your app to production makes it accessible to anyone on the Internet. To deploy, go back to the user dashboard and click on the [:icon{name="ph:rocket-launch"} Deploy]{.px-1 .bg-blue-200 .rounded-lg} button for your app. After a few minutes, the deployed app will be accessible by clicking on [:icon{name="ph:arrow-square-out"} Open]{.px-1 .bg-blue-200 .rounded-lg} or by typing `https://appname-yourusername.geniecloud.app` in the browser.
