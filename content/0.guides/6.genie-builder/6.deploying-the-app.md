### Deploying the app

Deploying your app to production makes it accessible to anyone on the Internet. To deploy, go back to the user dashboard and click on the [:icon{name="ph:rocket-launch"} Deploy]{.px-1 .bg-blue-200 .rounded-lg} button for your app.

After a few minutes, the deployed app will be accessible by clicking on [:icon{name="ph:arrow-square-out"} Open]{.px-1 .bg-blue-200 .rounded-lg} or by typing `https://appname-yourusername.dev.geniecloud.app` in the browser.

The deployed app will run in a machine with 4 cores and 8 GB of ram. If you need more computing power, [contact us](https://share.hsforms.com/19qEhiQB9QYKcSgf9gM8zzQchec7).
