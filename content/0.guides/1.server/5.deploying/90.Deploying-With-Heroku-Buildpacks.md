# Deploying Genie apps with Heroku Buildpacks


This tutorial shows how to host a Julia/Genie app using a Heroku Buildpack.


<a id='Prerequisites'></a>

## Prerequisites


This guide assumes you have a Heroku account and are signed into the Heroku CLI. [Information on how to setup the Heroku CLI is available here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

## The application


In order to try the deployment, you will need a sample application. Either pick one of yours or clone this sample one, as indicated next.

### All Steps (in easy copy-paste format):


Customize your `HEROKU_APP_NAME` to something unique:


```sh
HEROKU_APP_NAME=my-app-name
```


Clone a sample app if needed:


```sh
git clone https://github.com/milesfrain/GenieOnHeroku.git
```


Go into the app's folder:


```sh
cd GenieOnHeroku
```


And create a Heroku app:


```sh
heroku create $HEROKU_APP_NAME --buildpack https://github.com/Optomatica/heroku-buildpack-julia.git
```


Push the newly created app to Heroku:


```sh
git push heroku master
```


Now you can open the app in the browser:


```sh
heroku open -a $HEROKU_APP_NAME
```


If you need to check the logs:


```sh
heroku logs -tail -a $HEROKU_APP_NAME
```

### Steps with more detailed descriptions


<a id='Select-an-app-name'></a>

<a id='Select-an-app-name-1'></a>

#### Select an app name


```sh
HEROKU_APP_NAME=my-app-name
```


This must be unique among all Heroku projects, and is part of the url where your project is hosted (e.g. [https://my-app-name.herokuapp.com/](https://my-app-name.herokuapp.com/)).


If the name is not unique, you will see this error at the `heroku create` step.


```sh
Creating ⬢ my-app-name... !
 ▸    Name my-app-name is already taken
```


<a id='Clone-an-example-project'></a>

<a id='Clone-an-example-project-1'></a>

#### Clone an example project


```sh
git clone https://github.com/milesfrain/GenieOnHeroku.git
cd GenieOnHeroku
```


You may also point to your own project, but it must be a git repo.


A `Procfile` in the root contains the launch command to load your app. The contents of the `Procfile` for this project is this single line:


```sh
web: julia --project src/app.jl $PORT
```


You may edit the `Procfile` to point to your own project's launch script. (for example `src/my_app_launch_file.jl` instead of `src/app.jl`), but be sure to take into account the dynamically changing `$PORT` environment variable which is set by Heroku.


If you're deploying a standard Genie application built with `Genie.newapp`, the launch script will be `bin/server`. Genie will automatically pick the `$PORT` number from the environment.


<a id='Create-a-Heroku-project'></a>

<a id='Create-a-Heroku-project-1'></a>

#### Create a Heroku project


```sh
heroku create $HEROKU_APP_NAME --buildpack https://github.com/Optomatica/heroku-buildpack-julia.git
```


This creates a project on the Heroku platform, which includes a separate git repository.


This `heroku` repository is added to the list of tracked repositories and can be observed with `git remote -v`.


```sh
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/my-app-name.git (fetch)
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/my-app-name.git (push)
origin  https://github.com/milesfrain/GenieOnHeroku.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/milesfrain/GenieOnHeroku.git (push)
```


We are using a buildpack for Julia. This runs many of the common deployment operations required for Julia projects. It relies on the directory layout found in the example project, with `Project.toml`, `Manifest.toml` in the root, and all Julia code in the `src` directory.


<a id='Deploy-your-app'></a>

<a id='Deploy-your-app-1'></a>

#### Deploy your app


```sh
git push heroku master
```


This pushes your current branch of your local repo to the `heroku` remote repo's `master` branch.


Heroku will automatically execute the commands described in the Julia buildpack and Procfile of this latest push.


You must push to the heroku `master` branch to trigger an automated deploy.


<a id='Open-your-app's-webpage'></a>

<a id='Open-your-app's-webpage-1'></a>

#### Open your app's webpage


```sh
heroku open -a $HEROKU_APP_NAME
```


This is a convenience command to open your app's webpage in your browser.


The webpage is: `https://$HEROKU_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/`


For example: [https://my-app-name.herokuapp.com/](https://my-app-name.herokuapp.com/)


<a id='View-app-logs'></a>

<a id='View-app-logs-1'></a>

#### View app logs


```sh
heroku logs -tail -a $HEROKU_APP_NAME
```


This is another convenience command to launch a log viewer that remains open to show the latest status of your app.


The `println` statements from Julia will also appear here.


Exit this viewer with `Ctrl-C`.


Logs can also be viewed from the Heroku web dashboard. For example: [https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/my-app-name/logs](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/my-app-name/logs)

### Deploy app updates changes


To deploy any changes made to your app, simply commit those changes locally, and re-push to heroku.


```sh
<make changes>
git commit -am "my commit message"
git push heroku master
```
