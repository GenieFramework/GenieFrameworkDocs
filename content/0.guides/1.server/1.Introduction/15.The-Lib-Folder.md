# The `lib/` folder


Genie makes it easy to automatically load Julia code (modules, files, etc) into an app, outside of the standard Genie MVC app structure. You simply need to add your files and folders into the `lib/` folder.

**HEADS UP**


  * If the `lib/` folder does not exist, just create it yourself: `julia> mkdir("lib")`
  * Genie includes the files placed within the `lib/` folder and subfolders *recursively*
  * Files within `lib/` are loaded using `Revise` and are automatically reloaded if changed.
