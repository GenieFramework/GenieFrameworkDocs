### Debugging the app

Unlike typical Julia apps, apps in Genie Builder are not executed directly from the REPL. Instead, Genie Builder's App Manager controls the launching and stopping of apps from the App List. When an error in the code prevents an app from running, the App List displays a :icon{name="ph:bug"} icon next to the app's name.

To determine the source of an error, you can examine the logs. These are automatically generated and can provide useful information about the operation of the app and any issues that may have occurred.

The app maintains its logs in the `logs/` folder, generating a new log file each day.

The App Manager also keeps a log, which shows the output from the Julia REPL during the execution of an app. You can find it at `~/.julia/geniebuilder/log/`.
