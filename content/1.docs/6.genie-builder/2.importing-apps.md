### Importing entire apps

You can import an existing app's code by drag and dropping its code files onto the file explorer in the VSCode window. Moreover, you can also clone a github repository by opening a new terminal or with the Source Control plugin in the left sidebar.

After you've added the code, load the app into Genie Builder by picking Load App in the GENIE tab to the left. This will instantiate the packages from the Project.toml file, and run the app.

### Multiple apps

You can create multiple apps in Genie Builder. They will be listed under the GENIE tab to the left, and each will have a button to start and stop it.

However, keep in mind that you won't be able to deploy all apps at once from the same JuliaHub project. You need to create a separate project for each.
