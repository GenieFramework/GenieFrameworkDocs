## Choosing the transport layer: WebSockets or HTTP

By default Stipple will attempt to use WebSockets for real time data sync between backend and frontend.
However, in some cases WebSockets support might not be available on the host. In this case, Stipple can be
switched to use regular HTTP for data sync, using frontend polling with AJAX (1s polling interval by default).
Stipple can be configured to use AJAX/HTTP by passing the `transport` param to the `init()` method, ex:

```julia
model = Stipple.init(Name(), transport = Genie.WebThreads)
```

The current available options for `transport` are `Genie.WebChannels` (default, using WebSockets) and
`Genie.WebThreads` (using HTTP/AJAX).

Given that polling generates quite a number of extra requests, it can be desirable to disable automatic
logging of requests. This can be done using `Genie.config.log_requests = false`.

Here is a full example on how to configure an app to use HTTP/AJAX:

```julia
using GenieFramework

Genie.config.log_requests = false

@app Name begin
  @in name = "World!"
end

function ui()
    [
      h1([
        "Hello "
        span("{{name}}")
      ])

      p([
        "What is your name? "
        textfield("", :name, placeholder="Type your name")
      ])
    ]
end

route("/") do
  model = init(Name, transport = Genie.WebThreads)
  page(model, ui()) |> html
end

Genie.isrunning() || up()
```
