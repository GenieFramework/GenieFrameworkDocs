# Controlling load order of julia files

The default load sequence of Julia files inside the `plugins`, `libs`, `controllers` folders is alphabetical. However, sometimes you might want to control the default load order of `.jl` files. Let's assume we have a directory with a few of `.jl` files as follows

```
Aaa.jl
Abb.jl
Abc.jl
def.jl
Foo.jl
-x-yz.jl
```

To set the loading order, create a `.autoload` file in the directory containing your `.jl` listing the load order as:

```
--x-yz.jl
def.jl
Abc.jl
-Foo.jl
```

where (-) means exclude the file from Genie's autoload sequence and (--) means remove files starting with (-) from Genie Load sequence. Now the load order of our directory is going to be

```
def.jl
Abc.jl
Aaa.jl
Abb.jl
```

### `.autoload_ignore`: 

Creating an empty `.autoload_ignore` file in a directory causes all files contained in the folder to be excluded from Genie's startup load order.

2) `.autoload`
