# Multipage apps

There are several possible patterns for apps with reactive pages. For more details on building reactive apps, see the [Your first dashboard](/docs/guides/first-dashboard) guide and the [docs](/docs/reference/reactive-UI).

### Single app module with multiple pages

When building apps without too much logic, it might be sufficient to keep it all in a single module even if there's multiple pages. You just need to define additional routes for each page as in this example, which uses the `StatisticAnalysis` module defined [here](/docs/guides/first-dashboard):

```julia [app.jl]
module App
using GenieFramework
using Statistics
@genietools

# Implement reactive code
@app begin
    @in N = 0
    @out m = 0.0
    @out name = "John"
    @onchange N begin
        m = mean(rand(N))
    end
end

# Define the UI for each page
index() = [h1("Welcome {{name}}!"), a(href="/form")]
function formui()
    cell([
        textfield("How many numbers?", :N),
        p("The average of {{N}} random numbers is {{m}}"),
    ])
end


# Define the routes
@route("/", index) # use route instead of @page to avoid injecting unnecessary javascript
@page("/form", formui)
end
```

Alternatively, you can place the UI code in a separate file and include it as
```julia [app.jl]
@page("/", "ui.jl")
```

```julia [ui.jl]
    cell([
        textfield("How many numbers?", :N),
        p("The average of {{N}} random numbers is {{m}}"),
    ])
```

### Multiple app modules

If each page performs different functions, for instance a dashboard page and a another page with a configuration panel, you can implement them in separate logic modules. Then, simply include each module in the main `app.jl` as in this example:

```julia [app.jl]
module App
using GenieFramework
include("Index.jl")
include("Form.jl")
end
````



```julia [Index.jl]
module Index
using GenieFramework

@app begin
    @out name = "John"
end

function ui()
    h1("Welcome {{name}}!"),
end

@page("/", ui)
end
```

```julia [Form.jl]
module Form
using GenieFramework
using Statistics

@app begin
    @in N = 0
    @out m = 0.0
    @onchange N begin
        m = mean(rand(N))
    end
end

function ui()
    cell([
        textfield("How many numbers?", :N),
        p("The average of {{N}} random numbers is {{m}}"),
    ])
end

@page("/form", ui)
end
```
