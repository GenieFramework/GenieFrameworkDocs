# Creating an API

REST APIs provide a structured, standardized way to expose and access data and functionalities over the internet, making it easier to integrate different software systems. REST (Representational State Transfer) means that the server does not store any state about the client session. Each request is independent from previous ones.

Creating an API with Genie Framework is as easy as adding a set of endpoints linked to a specific functionality. Moreover, it is possible to automatically generate an API documentation page with Swagger.

### API endpoints

An API is comprised of multiple endpoints, each of which requires:

- A route that defines the URL path, parameters, handler,  and HTTP method to access a resource.

```julia
route("/api/hello/:name", greet, method=GET)
```

- A handler function that processes the request and returns a response
```julia
function greet()
    "Hello $(params(:name))"
end
```

Any information sent to the API is passed either as a parameter in the URL path for a GET request or in the body for a POST request. In the example above we'd pass the name with `/api/hello/John`. This can be then extracted by the handler with the `params` call.

Let's use the statistical analysis module from the [First multipage app](/docs/guides/first-multipage-app) guide:
```julia
module StatisticAnalysis
export gen_numbers, calc_mean
function gen_numbers(N::Int)
    return rand(N)
end
function calc_mean(x::Vector{Float64})
    return round(sum(x) / length(x); digits=4)
end
end

```

Suppose you want to make the `gen_numbers` function accessible via an API endpoint so that a vector of random numbers of length `N` at `/api/numbers/:N`. Create an `API` module to hold the endpoint handlers, and the route as

```julia
module App
using Genie

module StatisticAnalysis
    . . .
end

module API
using Genie.Requests
using Genie.Renderer.Json
using ..StatisticAnalysis
function numbers()
    json(:x => gen_numbers(payload(:N)))
end
end

route("/api/numbers/:N::Int", API.numbers)

end
```

Note that the response is formatted as a JSON dictionary in order to make it easier to consume by third parties. Moreover, the type of the `N` parameter in the URL is set to `Int` so that the `payload` function will return an `Int`.

Launch the app, and test it it with

```julia
❯ curl localhost:8000/api/numbers/10
{"x":[0.2599349703004966,0.41507586327531465,0.7117052551417936,0.04899936953416706,0.4841727037100556,0.6098044830424467,0.36874657414451883,0.7934650411840747,0.33030836077261927,0.5295794718912344]}%

```

### Accepting JSON payloads

A common requirement when exposing APIs is accepting POST payloads. That is, requests over `POST`, with a request body as a JSON encoded object. We can build an echo service like this:

```julia
using Genie, Genie.Renderer.Json, Genie.Requests
using HTTP

route("/echo", method = POST) do
  message = jsonpayload()
  (:echo => (message["message"] * " ") ^ message["repeat"]) |> json
end

route("/send") do
  response = HTTP.request("POST", "http://localhost:8000/echo", [("Content-Type", "application/json")], """{"message":"hello", "repeat":3}""")

  response.body |> String |> json
end

up(async = false)
```

Here we define two routes, `/send` and `/echo`. The `send` route makes a `HTTP` request over `POST` to `/echo`, sending a JSON payload with two values, `message` and `repeat`.
In the `/echo` route, we grab the JSON payload using the `Requests.jsonpayload()` function, extract the values from the JSON object, and output the `message` value repeated for a number of times equal to the `repeat` value.

If you run the code, the output should be

```javascript
{
  echo: "hello hello hello "
}
```

If the payload contains invalid JSON, the `jsonpayload` will be set to `nothing`. You can still access the raw payload by using the `Requests.rawpayload()` function.
You can also use `rawpayload` if for example the type of request/payload is not JSON.

### Documenting the API

It is beneficial idea to add a documentation page, making API endpoints discoverable user-friendly. You can use  the `SwaggUI.jl` and `SwaggerMarkdown` packages to individually document each endpoint and automatically generate a documentation page.

First, add a docstring to a route using the `@swagger` macro, following the [OpenAPI format](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/#:~:text=Swagger%20definitions%20can%20be%20written,swagger%3A%20%222.0%22):

```julia [app.jl]
using SwagUI, SwaggerMarkdown

@swagger """
/api/predict/{id}:
  get:
    description: Predict the MEDV of a house.
    parameters:
      - in: path
        name: N
        required: true
        description: Length of the random number vector.
        schema:
           type: integer
    responses:
      '200':
        description: OK
"""
route("/numbers/:N::Int", AnalysisController.api_numbers, method=GET)

```

Second, add a handler that builds the documentation page:

```julia [AnalysisController.jl]
function api_docs()
    info = Dict{String,Any}()
    info["title"] = "Statistic analysis API"
    info["version"] = "1.0.5"
    openApi = OpenAPI("3.0", info)
    swagger_document = build(openApi)

    render_swagger(swagger_document)
end
```

Finally, add a route to the documentation page:

```julia [app.jl]
route("/api/docs", api_docs)

```
