# Creating web pages

<!--Modern web applications are often characterized by their ability to generate content dynamically, tailoring web pages based on user interactions, database queries, or other factors. This guide provides an overview of how to create web pages with dynamic content.-->
<!---->
<!--Dynamic content refers to the parts of a web page that change based on varying factors such as user input, database changes, or real-time data. Instead of serving static HTML files, the server generates the content of the page on-the-fly, often pulling from databases or other data sources.-->

Web pages are accessed in the browser via a URL, which is mapped to a route in the server. The server then sends the HTML content of the page to the browser. To define a page with Genie, you can use the `route` function and the `do end` syntax to define the page's content as:

```julia[app.jl]
using GenieFramework
route("/message") do
    $name = "John"
    h1("Welcome to Genie $name !")
end
up() # start the server
```
If you paste the above code in the REPL, you can access the page by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/message` in your browser. To add more pages, simply define more routes with different endpoints.


### Low-code UI API

The page's code is written using Genie's low-code API, which implements the standard HTML tags like `p` for paragraphs, `h1` for headers, `img` for images, and so on. See the list of supported tags [here](https://github.com/GenieFramework/Genie.jl/blob/1cca8ffbb5e90f8fb4a5753179a9df103f2d78c1/src/renderers/Html.jl#L23-L32). 

You can nest elements by passing them as arguments like

```julia
Html.div(p("Welcome to Genie"))
Html.div([h1("Hello John"), p("Welcome to Genie")]) # nesting multiple elements
```
Moreover, you can pass arguments to the tags to set parameters or customize style. For instance, this code

```julia
Html.div([
    h1(style="color:red", "Welcome to Genie !"),
    a(href="/home", "Home")]
)
```

yields the following HTML:

```html
<div><h1 style="color:red">Welcome to Genie hello !</h1><a href="/home">Home</a></div>
```

You can test it yourself by pasting the code into the Julia REPL.

### Alternative page definitions

Besides using the `do end` syntax, you can also define the page's code in a function and pass it to the route as

```julia
hello() = h1("Welcome to Genie !")
route("/message", hello)
```

Moreover, you can define the page's code in a file and include it as

```julia[app.jl]
route("/message") do
    name = "John"
    html(Genie.Renderer.filepath("message.jl"), name=name)
end
```

```julia [message.jl]
h1("Welcome to Genie $name !")
```
The `html` function renders the code and adds information to the HTTP response header.


You can also use HTML by directly replacing the Julia code and files with HTML strings and files.

```julia[app.jl]
route("/message") do
    html(Renderer.filepath("pages/message.jl.html"))
end

```


```html [message.jl.html]
<h1>Welcome to Genie $name !</h1>
```

To learn more about the types of routes and how to pass parameters to a page, see the [routing](https://learn.genieframework.com/docs/reference/server/routing) section in the reference.

### Executing Julia code in a page

It is possible to embed Julia code in a page's code that will be executed when the page is loaded. To do so, use the `$` interpolation operator to wrap Julia code as

```julia [low-code]
p("1+1 is: $(1+1)")
```
```html [HTML]
<p>1+1 is: $(1+1)</p>
```

To include multiline code blocks, use the `<%` and `%>` delimiters as

```html [HTML]
<p>
    <% for i in 1:3 %>
    $i
    <% end %>
</p>
```
Remember to always pass any variable to be printed to the `html` renderer.

### Including static assets

To display static assets such as images, or include assets in the head of a page, place them first in the `public` folder. They will be automatically picked up by the server and served at the root path `/`. Then, the assets can be included in any page like in the example below.


```
.
├── app.jl
├── public/
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── meta.png
│   └── fig.png
```

```julia [app.jl]

function assets()
[
    head([
        meta(charset="utf-8")
        meta(name="og:image", content="/meta.png")
        link(rel="stylesheet", href=("/style.css"))
        title("Including assets")
    ])
    body([
            img(src="/fig.png",alt="plot")
        ])
]
end
route("/", assets)
```
