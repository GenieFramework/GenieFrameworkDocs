In this tutorial, we'll learn to build a
simple app for exploratory data analysis. The app will let us upload CSV
files and visualize the data distribution in a histogram, and we'll
interact through selectors to choose the CSV file and column to be
plotted. Take a look at the final app:

The full code and some sample CSV files can be downloaded from this
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/GenieFramework/GenieFrameworkDemos_NewAPI/tree/main/CSVAnalysis).

## Setup and app structure

We'll use `GenieFramework.jl`, `DataFrames.jl` and `CSV.jl` to build the
app. To install them, use the builtin [package manager](/guides/quickstart#add-your-julia-code), or launch a REPL and enter Pkg mode with `]` and type in the following
command:

``` julia
pkg> add GenieFramework DataFrames CSV
```

The app's code will have a main file `app.jl` for the logic,
`ui.jl` for the UI, and an `uploads` folder to store the datasets:

``` .bash
CSVAnalysis
├── app.jl
├── ui.jl
└── uploads/
```

We will not use the `app.jl.html` that is created by default.

## Implementation

Let's start by opening the `app.jl` file and adding the
following skeleton code:

``` julia
using GenieFramework, DataFrames, CSV
@genietools

#
# Logic goes here
#

@page("/", "ui.jl")
Server.isrunning() || Server.up()
```

The `@genietools` macro sets up the Genie environment and the `@page`
macro renders the app's UI, whereas the logic will be implemented in
between. For the `ui.jl` file this will be the skeleton code:

``` julia
[
    # 
    # UI definition goes here
    #
] |> string
```

The app has four components: an upload box, two selectors, and a
histogram plot. To implement each component, we'll need to:

-   Define the necessary variables and expose them to the UI.
-   Implement component's behavior.
-   Define component's UI in `ui.jl`.

### Upload box

The upload box lets us select a .csv file and store it on the server
side. The file is transmitted via an HTTP `POST` request, with the file
attached in the header. To enable this request, add the following
configuration lines to `app.jl`:

``` julia
Genie.config.cors_headers["Access-Control-Allow-Origin"]  =  "*"
Genie.config.cors_headers["Access-Control-Allow-Headers"] = "Content-Type"
Genie.config.cors_headers["Access-Control-Allow-Methods"] = "GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS"
Genie.config.cors_allowed_origins = ["*"]
```

Next, we'll create the storage folder if it doesn't already exist, and
give our app page a title.

``` julia
const FILE_PATH = "upload"
mkpath(FILE_PATH)
@out title = "CSV Analysis"
```

The `@out` macro makes it so the code in the UI can access the value of
a variable. Before adding more logic, let us proceed with the UI.

The UI is structured via Julia functions that implement various HTML and
Javascript components. To add the page title and upload box, write in
`ui.jl` the following:

``` julia
[
    heading("{{title}}")
    row([
        cell(class="col-md-12", [
            uploader(label="Upload Dataset", accpt=".csv", multiple=true, method="POST", url="http://localhost:8000/", field__name="csv_file")
        ])
    ])
] |> string
```

<img style="display:block;width:40%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/tutorials/csv-file-uploader/uploadbox.png" />

While `heading`, `row` and `cell` simply generate the HTML code for
headers and dividers, the `uploader` function generates the Javascript
allowing us to pick and upload a file. The `url` argument points to the
address where the `POST` request will be submitted, and so we'll require
a route on the server that handles the request. For this, add the
following code to `app.jl`:

``` julia
route("/", method = POST) do
  files = Genie.Requests.filespayload()
  for f in files
      write(joinpath(FILE_PATH, f[2].name), f[2].data)
  end
  if length(files) == 0
      @info "No file uploaded"
  end
  return "Upload finished"
end
```

The `route` function sets up a listener function at a path that will be
executed for incoming requests. Instead of defining a standalone
function that stores the file in the request header, we've used Julia's
`do end` syntax which builds an anonymous function with the code in the
block and passes it to `route`.

The upload box is now finished and working. Give it a try by [launching a preview](/guides/quickstart#launch-the-workspace) in a new browser tab.

### File and column selectors

Once we have the .csv file uploaded, we want to access its contents and
choose one column for plotting. We'll do the choosing through two
selectors, which rely on several variables to store:

-   The selected file, and the list of uploaded files.
-   The selected column in a file, and the list of columns in the file.

Let's add to `app.jl` the variables with default values as

``` julia
@in selected_file = "iris.csv"
@in selected_column = "petal.length"
@out upfiles = readdir(FILE_PATH)
@out columns = ["petal.length", "petal.width", "sepal.length", "sepal.width", "variety"]
```

Note that we tag the selection variables with `@in` as they'll be
storing values sent from the UI.

Now, we define the UI with

``` julia
row([
cell(class="st-module", [
  h6("File")
  Stipple.select(:selected_file; options=:upfiles)
])
cell(class="st-module", [
  h6("Column")
  Stipple.select(:selected_column; options=:columns)
])
```

<img style="display:block;width:40%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/tutorials/csv-file-uploader/selectors.png" />

The selectors are generated by `Stipple.select`, which takes as first
argument the symbol name of the variable where the selected value will
be stored.

As of now, when the user makes a selection the chosen values are stored
in the corresponding variables. All we need to do now is use these
values to generate the histogram plot.

### Histogram

Since all the interactive elements are already implemented, we'll add to
`app.jl` the reactive code that

1.  Loads the CSV file into a DataFrame.
2.  Refreshes the column selector choices with the column names of the
    selected file.
3.  Plots the histogram of the selected column.

For the plotting, we'll use a `PlotData` struct that can be
parameterized to different plot types such as scatter plots or
histograms. We'll define the variable storing the plot as

``` julia
@out irisplot = PlotData()
```

In Genie, reactive code is implemented within a handler defined with the
`@handlers` macro. In it, we use the `@onchangeany` macro to act
whenever a variable changes in the UI as follows:

``` julia
@handlers begin
    @onchangeany isready, selected_file, selected_column begin
        upfiles = readdir(FILE_PATH)
        data = CSV.read(joinpath(FILE_PATH, selected_file), DataFrame)
        columns = names(data)
        if selected_column in names(data)
            irisplot = PlotData(x=data[!, selected_column], plot=StipplePlotly.Charts.PLOT_TYPE_HISTOGRAM)
        end
    end
end
```

Notice the `isready` variable, which is provided by Genie to indicate
when the browser has finished loading the UI. Finally, the code for the
UI element to display the plot is

``` julia
  row([
    cell(class="st-module", [
      h5("Histogram")
      plot(:irisplot)
    ])
 ])
```

That's it, we're done! Now you can run the full app and add some more
functionality if you'd like. Here are some ideas:

-   Add a scatter plot.
-   Add other interactive elements such as sliders to change the
    parameters of the plot.
-   Add the clustering algorithm from the [Iris tutorial](/tutorials/written/iris-clustering-dashboard/)
    and try it on different datasets.
