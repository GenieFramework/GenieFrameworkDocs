# Dashboard for Iris dataset clustering

This tutorial will guide you through using the [low-code API](/guides/no-code-ui-editor/designing-the-ui-lowcode) to develop a web app for
the classification of flower samples belonging to several species. We’ll
be using the Iris Dataset, which is commonly used to showcase machine
learning applications. In this dataset, we have tabular data describing
150 flower samples in terms of their petal length, petal width, sepal
length, sepal width and species.

Our objective is to, based only on the petal and sepal dimensions, group
together those samples belonging to the same species. This is an
unsupervised learning problem that we’ll solve through clustering with
the k-means algorithm. Further, we will deliver the solution as an
interactive web app built with Genie Framework.

A Genie app is typically developed in three parts:

1.  Data processing logic: the code a data scientist would write to
    extract insights from data.
2.  Dashboard logic: the layer that connects data structures with the
    user interface.
3.  User interface: the interactive user-facing part of the app.

The tutorial will go into each of these steps and, by the end, we’ll
have a beautiful dashboard like the one in the figure below. The full
code can be found [here](https://github.com/GenieFramework/GenieBuilderDemos/tree/main/iris).

### Setup

Regarding the file structure of the project, it is very simple: inside
the project folder `IrisClustering` we’ll have the main executable file
`dashboard.jl` containing the data and dashboard logic, and `ui.jl`
containing the UI.

<div class="code-with-filename">

**Project file structure**

``` bash
IrisClustering
├── dashboard.jl
└── ui.jl
```

</div>

Besides `GenieFramework`, we require the following packages:
`RDatasets`, `DataFrames` and `Clustering`. To add them to the Julia
install, enter package mode pressing “\]” and input

``` julia
add RDatasets DataFrames Clustering GenieFramework
```

Once the install is finished, we’re ready to start adding code.

::alert{type="info"}
This tutorial was initially written for local development. If you're following on Genie Cloud, use app.jl as the main file instead of dashboard.jl, and install packages from the development environment's package manager.
::

# Data processing logic

This first part implements the data gathering and analysis in our app.
The Iris dataset is readily available in the `RDatasets.jl` package, so
let’s take a quick look at its contents with the code below.

```julia
#| echo: true
using DataFrames
using RDatasets: dataset

irisdata = dataset("datasets", "iris")
# show 5 random rows
idx = rand(1:nrow(irisdata), 5)
irisdata[idx,:]
```

<img style="display:block;width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/tutorials/iris-clustering-dashboard/table.png" />

Notice that the first four columns in the table have numerical values,
which constitute the features in the dataset. The last column has
categorical values, corresponding to the data labels. These take one of
three values: virginica, setosa or versicolor.

We’ll use the k-means algorithm to classify the flower samples. This
algorithm takes as input the features of each sample, that is, the first
four columns in the data matrix, and groups together those flower
samples with similar features to obtain `k=3` separate clusters. We hope
that k-means will give samples from the same species the same cluster
number, hence resulting in species classification.

For a ready-made implementation using the `Clustering.jl` package,
create the script `dashboard.jl` with the following code:

```julia
using RDatasets: dataset
using DataFrames, Clustering
const data = DataFrames.insertcols!(dataset("datasets", "iris"), :Cluster => zeros(Int, 150))
const features = [:SepalLength, :SepalWidth, :PetalLength, :PetalWidth]

function cluster(no_of_clusters = 3, no_of_iterations = 10)
  # Put all feature vectors in a matrix, call kmeans to obtain cluster 
  # assignments and store assignments in data matrix
  feats = Matrix(data[:, [c for c in features]])' |> collect
  result = kmeans(feats, no_of_clusters; maxiter = no_of_iterations)
  data[!, :Cluster] = assignments(result)
end
```

Note that we have added a column to the data matrix to store the result
of k-means. If we execute the `cluster` function, we obtain

```julia
cluster()
data[idx,:]
```
<img style="display:block;width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/tutorials/iris-clustering-dashboard/table2.png" />

The column `data` now contains the cluster assignments made by k-means.
It seems that, for the shown samples, each species has a different
cluster assignment; this indicates a successful classification.

To explore the algorithm and the accuracy of its results, we will build
a dashboard with the following: visualization of the clusters, and
controls to rerun the clustering with different parameters.

### Dashboard logic

The dashboard logic controls which variables are exposed to the user
interface, and what code is executed on user interaction. The UI
elements in our app, and the variables or arguments they depend on are:

- Plot showing the real species of each sample: `data`, `features`.
- Plot showing the assigned cluster number for each sample: `data`,
  `features`.
- Table showing the contents of the dataset: `data`.
- Two selectors to choose the x and y axes of the plots: `features`.
- Sliders to change the number of clusters and number of iterations of
  the algorithm: `no_of_clusters`, `no_of_iterations`.

Therefore, we’ll need to expose the listed variables to the UI. There
are two macros to set the access properties of a variable:

- `@in`: the variable takes its value from an element in the UI.
- `@out`: the value of the variable is shown in a UI element.

Furthermore, we have two other macros to control interaction:

- `@handlers`: sets up the server-side code that is run when values
  change.
- `@onchangeany`: detects changes on a variable tagged with `@in` and
  executes some code.

Putting all of this together, we implement the dashboard logic as

``` julia

using GenieFramework
# set up automatic reload and other dev tools
@genietools

# make feature names readable from the UI
@out const features = [:SepalLength, :SepalWidth, :PetalLength, :PetalWidth]

# set up reactive code
@handlers begin
  # variables taking their value from sliders and selectors
  @in no_of_clusters = 3
  @in no_of_iterations = 10
  @in xfeature = :SepalLength
  @in yfeature = :SepalWidth
  # variables that hold plot and table data
  @out datatable = DataTable()
  @out datatablepagination = DataTablePagination(rows_per_page=50)
  @out irisplot = PlotData[]
  @out clusterplot = PlotData[]
  @out title = "My Iris Dashboard"

  # when any of the variables tagged with @in change, re-execute 
  @onchangeany isready, xfeature, yfeature, no_of_clusters, no_of_iterations begin
    cluster(no_of_clusters, no_of_iterations)
    datatable = DataTable(data)
    irisplot = plotdata(data, xfeature, yfeature; groupfeature = :Species)
    clusterplot = plotdata(data, xfeature, yfeature; groupfeature = :Cluster)
  end
end
```

Besides re-calculating the cluster assignments when the parameters
change, the code in the `@onchangeany` block updates the plots. Each
call to `plotdata` returns a struct of type `PlotData`, which is the
type accepted by the plotting functions in the UI code we’ll write
later.

Now that the dashboard logic is implemented, we just need to add two
more instructions to render the UI, and run the server:

``` julia
@page("/", "ui.jl")
Server.isrunning() || Server.up()
```

The `@page` macro takes as input the path to the web app, and the file
containing the UI definition. The final code in `dashboard.jl` combining
the data and dashboard logic can be viewed in the code fold below.


::CodeFold
#header
dashboard.jl

#content
```julia
using Clustering
import RDatasets: dataset
import DataFrames

using GenieFramework
@genietools

const data = DataFrames.insertcols!(dataset("datasets", "iris"), :Cluster => zeros(Int, 150))
@out const features = [:SepalLength, :SepalWidth, :PetalLength, :PetalWidth]

function cluster(no_of_clusters = 3, no_of_iterations = 10)
  feats = Matrix(data[:, [c for c in features]])' |> collect
  result = kmeans(feats, no_of_clusters; maxiter = no_of_iterations)
  data[!, :Cluster] = assignments(result)
end

@handlers begin
  @in no_of_clusters = 3
  @in no_of_iterations = 10
  @in xfeature = :SepalLength
  @in yfeature = :SepalWidth
  @out datatable = DataTable()
  @out datatablepagination = DataTablePagination(rows_per_page=50)
  @out irisplot = PlotData[]
  @out clusterplot = PlotData[]
  @out title = "My Iris Dashboard"

  @onchangeany isready, xfeature, yfeature, no_of_clusters, no_of_iterations begin
    cluster(no_of_clusters, no_of_iterations)
    datatable = DataTable(data)
    irisplot = plotdata(data, xfeature, yfeature; groupfeature = :Species)
    clusterplot = plotdata(data, xfeature, yfeature; groupfeature = :Cluster)
  end
end

@page("/", "ui.jl")

Server.isrunning() || Server.up()
```
::

Finally, we proceed to define the UI.

### User interface

To implement the UI we don't need to write a single line of HTML or Javascript, it can be entirely done in Julia. The static UI elements are created by functions that generate the corresponding HTML code, as in



```julia
using GenieFramework
row(h5("Hello"))
```

```html[output]
"<div class=\"row\"><h5>Hello</h5></div>"
```

Furthermore, we have functions that generate a combination of HTML and
Javascript for interactive UI elements. As a first example, let us look
at the code for one of the plots:

``` julia
cell(class="st-module", [
  h5("k-means clusters")
  plot(:clusterplot)
])
```

The code first defines a cell divider with CSS class `st-module`; the
CSS code is automatically generated. The `cell` generator function takes
as an argument the list of elements that it will hold; in this case a
header and the plot. The plot function’s only argument is the symbol
name of the variable of type `PlotData` to be plotted.

As a second example, for one of the sliders we have:

``` julia
cell(class="st-module", [
  h6("Number of clusters")
  slider( 1:1:20,
          :no_of_clusters;
          label=true)
])
```

The `slider` function takes as arguments the number range, the symbol
name of variable to be changed, and the popup shown on user click.

The full UI is built by stacking the UI elements into an array and
converting the result into a string, as in the full code of `ui.jl`
shown below.

<div class="code-with-filename">

**ui.jl**

``` julia
[
  # insert contents of string var. using double mustache {{}} syntax
  heading("{{title}}")

  row([
    # sliders
    cell(class="st-module", [
      h6("Number of clusters")
      slider( 1:1:20,
              :no_of_clusters;
              label=true)
    ])
    cell(class="st-module", [
      h6("Number of iterations")
      slider( 10:10:200,
              :no_of_iterations;
              label=true)
    ])
    # selectors
    cell(class="st-module", [
      h6("X feature")
      Stipple.select(:xfeature; options=:features)
    ])

    cell(class="st-module", [
      h6("Y feature")
      Stipple.select(:yfeature; options=:features)
    ])
  ])
  # plots
  row([
    cell(class="st-module", [
      h5("Species clusters")
      plot(:irisplot)
    ])

    cell(class="st-module", [
      h5("k-means clusters")
      plot(:clusterplot)
    ])
  ])
  # table
  row([
    cell(class="st-module", [
      h5("Iris data")
      table(:datatable; dense=true, flat=true, style="height: 350px;", pagination=:datatablepagination)
    ])
  ])
] |> string
```

</div>

### Running the app

Now that we have finished coding the app, all is left to do is run it.
Open the Julia REPL in the app folder and type in the following:

``` julia
include("dashboard.jl")
```

Genie will render and serve the app, which can be accessed via
<http://localhost:8000>.
