# Working with forms

This guide will show you how to create a simple app in which the user can enter a value and trigger a computation, with the result being displayed afterwards.


Then, we'll turn the above code into a web app, the app where the user will enter a value for `N`, and the mean will be displayed as in this preview:

<img class="border-gray-300 border-2" style="display:block;width:90%;max-width:40%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/docs/guides/first-genie-app/preview.gif">

Moreover, we'll add a reactive page where the analysis is triggered when the user types a value in the text field:

<img class="border-gray-300 border-2" style="display:block;width:90%;max-width:40%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/docs/guides/first-genie-app/reactive.gif">

### Running the app

For this demo Genie app, we'll start with a `StatisticAnalysis` module with functions to generate a vector of random numbers and calculate its mean:


```julia [StatisticAnalysis.jl]
module StatisticAnalysis

export gen_numbers, calc_mean

function gen_numbers(N::Int)
    return rand(N)
end

function calc_mean(x::Vector{Float64})
    return round(sum(x) / length(x); digits=4)
end
end

```

Start with an empty project folder and create a `lib/` folder in it. Then, place the `StatisticAnalysis.jl` file inside `lib/`. The contents of this folder will be automatically loaded into the `Main` module when the app is run.

Next, create a file `app.jl`, which will be the entry point to the app, with the following content:

```julia
module App
using GenieFramework
using Main.StatisticAnalysis
@genietools

end
```
The `GenieFramework` package includes everything you'll need to build the web app, and the `@genietools` macro enables features such as logging and hot code reloading. 


This is what the file structure should look like so far:

```
.
├── app.jl
└── lib/
    └── StatisticAnalysis.jl
```

To launch the app, start a Julia REPL with `julia --project` in the project folder and run

```julia
using GenieFramework; Genie.loadapp(); up()
```

This will start a server on port `8000` and you can access the app at http://localhost:8000. To stop the server, execute `down()` in the REPL.

Now that you've set up the computational code and the app is running, it's time to add the pages to trigger the analysis and display the results.


### Welcome page

Let's start with a simple index page at the root `/` path with a link to the number input form. You can create it with a route, which takes a as an argument an action function that returns the content of the page:


```julia [app.jl] {6-9}
module App
using GenieFramework
using Main.StatisticAnalysis

route("/") do
    [ h4("Welcome to the number analysis module"),
      a("Numbers form", href="/form") ]
end

end

```

The `h4` and `a` functions come from Genie's low-code UI API, in which each function generates the corresponding HTML element. This allows you to implement pages in pure Julia. When you run the app, you should see the page at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Number input form page

The second page will have a form with an input field to introduce the length of the vector of random numbers, with a submit button to send the information to the server. For this page, create a route `/form` the following content in its action function:

```julia [app.jl]
route("/form") do
    Html.form(action = "/result", method="POST", [
        input(type="number", name="N", placeholder="Enter vector length")
        input(type="submit", value="Send")
    ])
end
```
The `action` parameter in the `form` element specifies the path to which the form data will be sent, and `method` specifies the HTTP method. We'll use `POST` to send the data enclosed in the body of the HTTP request. An alternative would be `GET`, with the data being appended to the URL as `/result?N=[value]`.

Inside the form, the `number` type input will show as an input box, whereas the `submit` type input will appear as the button that submits the form. 

### Results page

When the form is submitted, a `POST` request will be sent to the `/result` path, where the analysis will be performed with the form data. For the results page, define a route implementing the processing as

```julia [app.jl]
using GenieFramework.Genie.Requests: postpayload
route("/result", method=POST) do
    N = parse(Int, postpayload(:N))
    x = gen_numbers(N)
    m = calc_mean(x)
    p("The mean of $N random numbers is: $m", style="font-size:20px")
end

```
The `postpayload` call from the `Requests` module extracts the value of `N` from the header of the `POST` request submitted by the form. Then, the analysis is performed and a response with the result is rendered. The usual Julia string interpolation syntax is used to display the value of `N` and `m`.

### Reactive form page

In some applications like dashboards, you might want to update parts of the UI when the user interacts with a component. When these updates happen without a page reload, this is known as reactivity. Genie Framework provides an elegant API to implement reactive APPs with two-way instant synchronization between the backend and the page. To introduce it, we'll reimplement the number analysis form.

Create a new module `ReactiveForm.jl` with the following content:

```julia [ReactiveForm.jl]
module ReactiveForm
using GenieFramework
using .Main.App.StatisticAnalysis
@genietools

@app begin
    @in N = 0
    @out m = 0.0
    @onchange N begin
        m = calc_mean(gen_numbers(N))
    end
end

function ui()
    cell([
        textfield("How many numbers?", :N),
        p("The average of {{N}} random numbers is {{m}}"),
    ])
end

@page("/reactive", ui)
end

```
Then, include the module in `app.jl` by appending `include("ReactiveForm.jl")` to the end of the file as

```julia
module App
using GenieFramework
using Main.StatisticAnalysis

# . . .

include("Reactiveform.jl")
```
In the flow implemented by `ReactiveForm.jl`, when the user types a number in the text field a reactive variable `N` is updated with the new value. This update triggers a handler that recalculates the mean and stores it in a reactive variable `m`, whose value will be automatically sent to the UI. As you can see in the gif below, all of this happens without a page reload.

<img class="border-gray-300 border-2" style="display:block;width:90%;max-width:40%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/docs/guides/first-genie-app/reactive.gif">

Now, let's break down the code into its parts:

1. **Imports**: besides importing `GenieFramework` we also import the data analysis code from `StatisticAnalysis`. This code could also have been defined in the module itself.
2. **Reactive code**: the block delimited by the `@app` macro implements the reactive code, which controls the app's interaction with the user.
3. **Reactive variables**: the variables tagged with `@in` and `@out` monitor their own value so that when it changes, the changes are automatically propagated to the UI. The `@in` macro specifies a variable that can be modified from the UI, whereas `@out` defines a read-only variable only modifiable from the Julia code.

```julia
    @in N = 0
    @out m = 0.0
```

4. **Reactive handler**: the `@onchange` macro defines a handler that is executed when the value of the tagged variable changes.
```julia
    @onchange N begin
        m = calc_mean(gen_numbers(N))
    end
```
5. **UI function**: as seen previously, the UI is implemented in a `ui` function with the low-code API. The `textfield` is bound to the `N` variable, which will store the component's state. Moreover, the `{{}}` syntax is used to display a reactive variable's value in a page.
```julia
function ui()
    cell([
        textfield("How many numbers?", :N),
        p("The average of {{N}} random numbers is {{m}}"),
    ])
end
```
6. **Route**: the `@page` macro defines a route that will render the specified `ui` function.
```julia
@page("/reactive", ui)
```
