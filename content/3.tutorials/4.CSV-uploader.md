# CSV uploader app

In this tutorial, we'll learn to build a
simple app for exploratory data analysis. The app will let us upload CSV
files and visualize the data distribution in a histogram, and we'll
interact through selectors to choose the CSV file and column to be
plotted. Take a look at the final app:

The full code and some sample CSV files can be downloaded from this
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/BuiltWithGenie/CSVUploader).

## Setup and app structure

We'll use `GenieFramework.jl`, `DataFrames.jl` and `CSV.jl` to build the
app. To install them, enter Pkg mode with `]` and type in the following
command:

``` julia
pkg> add GenieFramework DataFrames CSV PlotlyBase
```

The app's code will have a main file `app.jl` for the logic,
`ui.jl` for the UI, and a `public/uploads` folder to store the datasets:

``` bash
CSVAnalysis
├── app.jl
├── ui.jl
└── public/uploads/
```

## Implementation

Let's start by opening the `app.jl` file and adding the
following skeleton code:

``` julia
using GenieFramework, DataFrames, CSV, PlotlyBase
@genietools

@app
# Logic goes here
end

@page("/", "ui.jl")
```

The `@genietools` macro sets up the Genie environment and the `@page`
macro renders the app's UI, whereas the logic will be implemented in
between. For the `ui.jl` file this will be the skeleton code:

``` julia
[
 heading("CSV Analysis"),
 row([ ]),
 row([ ]),
 row([ ])
]
```

The app has four components: an upload box, two selectors, and a
histogram plot. To implement each component, we'll need to:

-   Define component's UI in `ui.jl`.
-   Define the necessary variables and expose them to the UI.
-   Implement the component's behavior.

### Upload box

The upload box lets us select a .csv file and store it on the server
side. Add one to the page by editing `ui.jl` as follows:

```julia
[
 heading("CSV Analysis")
 row([
      cell(class="col-md-12", 
          [
          uploader( multiple = true,
              accept = ".csv",
              maxfilesize = 1024*1024*1, # bytes
              maxfiles = 3,
              autoupload = true,
              hideuploadbtn = true,
              label = "Upload datasets",
              nothumbnails = true,
              style="max-width: 95%; width: 95%; margin: 0 auto;",

              @on("rejected", :rejected),
              @on("uploaded", :uploaded)
              )

          ])
 ])
. . .
```

The `uploader` component takes many parameters to control its behavior, see its docstring for more information. It also emits several events when actions are performed which can be intercepted in the backend; we'll use the `uploaded` and `rejected` events to notify the user when the upload is finished or if the file is invalid.

When a file is uploaded, it is stored in a temporary folder in the server. The path to this file, and other information, is stored in the reactive variable `fileuploads`. This variable is automatically created when the user loads the page. We'll attach a handler to `fileuploads` in order to manage the files. Add the following to the `@app` block in `app.jl`:


```julia

const FILE_PATH = joinpath("public", "uploads")
mkpath(FILE_PATH)
@app begin
    @out upfiles = readdir(FILE_PATH)
    @onchange fileuploads begin
        if ! isempty(fileuploads)
            @info "File was uploaded: " fileuploads
            filename = fileuploads["name"]

            try
                isdir(FILE_PATH) || mkpath(FILE_PATH)
                mv(fileuploads["path"], joinpath(FILE_PATH, filename), force=true)
            catch e
                @error "Error processing file: $e"
                notify(__model__,"Error processing file: $(fileuploads["name"])")
            end

            fileuploads = Dict{AbstractString,AbstractString}()
        end
        upfiles = readdir(FILE_PATH)
    end
    @event uploaded begin
        @info "uploaded"
        notify(__model__, "File was uploaded")
    end
    @event rejected begin
        @info "rejected"
        notify(__model__, "Please upload a valid file")
    end
end
```

When activated, the handler will move the uploaded file from its temporary location to `FILE_PATH` and notify the user. We've also added the `upfiles` variable to store the list of uploaded files, which will then be used to populate the file selector. Finally, the `@event` macro defines handlers for the received events.

With this, you can already run your app to test it as
```julia
using GenieFramework; Genie.loadapp(); up()
```
This will start a server and you can access the app at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### File and column selectors

Once we have uploaded a .csv file , we want to access its contents and
choose one column for plotting. We'll do the choosing through two
selectors, which you can add to the second row in `ui.jl` as 

```julia
row([
     cell(
          class="st-module",
          [
           h6("File")
           Stipple.select(:selected_file; options=:upfiles)
          ]
         )
     cell(
          class="st-module",
          [
           h6("Column")
           Stipple.select(:selected_column; options=:columns)
          ]
         )
    ])
```

The selectors are generated by `Stipple.select`, which takes as first
argument the symbol name of the variable where the selected value will
be stored.

Assuming the app comes with the [Iris dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuiltWithGenie/CSVUploader/main/upload/iris.csv) preloaded, define now the reactive variables for each selector with default values as:

``` julia
@in selected_file = "iris.csv"
@in selected_column = "petal.length"
@out upfiles = readdir(FILE_PATH)
@out columns = ["petal.length", "petal.width", "sepal.length", "sepal.width", "variety"]
```

Note that we tag the selection variables with `@in` as they'll be
storing values sent from the UI.

<img style="display:block;width:40%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="/assets/tutorials/csv-file-uploader/selectors.png" />

When a new file is selected, the dataset must is loaded into memory and the list of columns that can be plotted updated. First, add a new private variable to store the dataset:
```julia
    @private data = DataFrame()
```
This variable is tagged with `@private` since each user needs to have its own copy, but the variale doesn't need to be sent to the browser.

Now, add a handler to load the data and column list when the file selector changes:
```julia
    @onchange isready,selected_file begin
        data = CSV.read(joinpath(FILE_PATH, selected_file), DataFrame)
        columns = names(data)
    end
```
We've also attached the handler to the `isready` variable, which becomes true when the page is finished loading, so that we won't start with an empty page with no selection.

### Histogram

After selecting a dataset, we want to plot a histogram of one of its plots every time we make a new selection with the column selector. Genie uses Plotly for plots, which requires a trace to store the data on the plot, and a layout to define the plot's aesthetics. See the [plotting reference](https://learn.genieframework.com/docs/reference/reactive-ui/plotting) for more info.

Add the trace and layout via reactive variables as:
```julia
    @out trace = [histogram()]
    @out layout = PlotlyBase.Layout(yaxis_title_text="Count",xaxis_title_text="Value")
```
The `PlotlyBase` prefix is necessary to avoid clashes with `GenieFramework.Layout`.

Then, add a handler to update the trace when the column selector changes:
```julia
    @onchange isready, selected_column begin
        trace = [histogram(x=data[!, selected_column])]
    end
```
Finally, add the plot to the last row in `ui.jl` as:
```julia
row([
     cell(
          class="st-module",
          [
           h5("Histogram")
           plot(:trace, layout=:layout)
          ]
         )
    ])
```

That's it, we're done! Now you can run the full app and add some more
functionality if you'd like. Here are some ideas:

-   Add a scatter plot.
-   Add other interactive elements such as sliders to change the
    parameters of the plot.
-   Add the clustering algorithm from the [Iris tutorial](/tutorials/written/iris-clustering-dashboard/)
    and try it on different datasets.
